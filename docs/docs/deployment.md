# Deployment

## Docker

Configure the Slack provider (See "[Run locally](https://github.com/keephq/keep#from-now-on-keep-should-be-installed-locally-and-accessible-from-your-cli-test-it-by-executing)" on how to obtain the webhook URL)

```bash
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it keephq/cli config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```

You should now have a providers.yaml file created locally

Run Keep and execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert

```bash
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it keephq/cli -j run --alert-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml
```

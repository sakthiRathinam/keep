## üóº A glance of Keep

Keep is a simple CLI tool that contains everything you need to start creating Alerts.

- 10s of providers ready to use with your own data
- Simple CLI tool to configure, trigger and test your alerts
- Easily deployable via docker, vercel, github actions, etc.
- Alerts are managed by simple yaml files that are human-readable

Brought to you by developers, EASY to use and managable by code.

## üö® Providers

[Providers](https://keephq.wiki/providers/what-is-a-provider) are Keep's way of interacting with 3rd party products; Keep uses them either to query data or to send notifications.

We tried our best to cover all common providers, [missing any?](https://github.com/keephq/keep/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature,provider&template=feature_request.md&title=Missing%20PROVIDER_NAME), providers include:

- **Cloud**: AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.
- **Monitoring**: Sentry, New Relic, Datadog, etc.
- **Incident Management**: PagerDuty, OpsGenie, etc.
- **Communication**: Email, Slack, Console, etc.
- [and more...](https://github.com/keephq/keep/tree/main/keep/providers)

## üöÄ Quickstart

### Run locally

Try our first mock alert and get it up and running in <5 minutes - Ready? Let's Go! ‚è∞

<h5>First, clone Keep repository:</h5>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/keephq/keep.git && cd keep
```

<h5>Install Keep CLI</h5>

```shell
pip install .
```

or

```shell
poetry shell
poetry install
```

<h5>From now on, Keep should be installed locally and accessible from your CLI, test it by executing:</h5>

```
keep version
```

Get a Slack incoming webhook using [this tutorial](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and use Keep to configure it:

```
keep config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```

Paste the Slack Incoming Webhook URL (e.g. <https://hooks.slack.com/services/...>) and you're good to go üëå

<h5>Let's now execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert</h5>

```bash
keep run --alerts-file examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml
```

<div align="center">

    <br />
    <img src="/docs/static/img/alert-example.png">
    <br />
    You should have received your first "Dunder Mifflin Paper Company" alert in Slack by now.
    <br />
</div>


### Docker

Configure the Slack provider (See "[Run locally](https://github.com/keephq/keep#from-now-on-keep-should-be-installed-locally-and-accessible-from-your-cli-test-it-by-executing)" on how to obtain the webhook URL)

```bash
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it keephq/cli config provider --provider-type slack --provider-id slack-demo
```

You should now have a providers.yaml file created locally

Run Keep and execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert

```bash
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -it keephq/cli -j run --alert-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keephq/keep/main/examples/alerts/db_disk_space.yml
```

### Render
Click the Deploy to Render button to deploy Keep as a background worker running in [Render](https://www.render.com)

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/keephq/keep)

To run Keep and execute our example "Paper DB has insufficient disk space" alert, you will need to configure you Slack provider.
<br />
When clicking the Deploy to Render button, you will be asked to provide the `KEEP_PROVIDER_SLACK_DEMO` environment variable, this is the expected format:

```json
{"authentication": {"webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."}}
```

\* Refer to [Run locally](https://github.com/keephq/keep#from-now-on-keep-should-be-installed-locally-and-accessible-from-your-cli-test-it-by-executing) on how to obtain the webhook URL
